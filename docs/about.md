# About

This project was developed as part of a course project at the University of Maryland. For more information see the wiki documentation at [Visual Analysis of the Employment Situation in the United States](https://wiki.cs.umd.edu/cmsc734_s15/index.php/Visual_Analysis_of_the_Employment_Situation_in_the_United_States).

## Name Origin

ELMR is a forced, made-up acronym for "Economic Labor Measurement Report". None of the team except [@bbengfort](https://github.com/bbengfort) seem to appreciate this name, but because it is short it has stuck. Formerly it is referred to as the "Jobs Report Visualization".
